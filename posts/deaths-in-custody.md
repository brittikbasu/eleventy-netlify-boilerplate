A 'death in custody' is a generic term which refers to deaths of those in the custody of the State. A non-fatal shooting or severe and extensive injury is not sufficient; there must be a death. However, a death in a road traffic incident, even if the person who dies is under arrest and heading towards a police station in a police car, is not a death in custody.

The deceased must have been 'in custody'. The following list illustrates some circumstances that may apply to this definition:

* whilst under arrest in a police station;
* whilst held as a prisoner in a prison or police station;
* whilst under arrest by a police officer;
* whilst being detained for the purposes of a search;
* whilst in other lawful detention e.g. immigration detention (but not where the victim is compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 **except** where the person is still in police custody before being transferred to a medical facility);
* whilst a child or young person is in custody for their own protection;
* as a result of being shot by a police officer; or
* following any other 'contact with the police' where there may be a link between the contact and the death.

The identity or employment of the person who caused the death is immaterial in all cases except fatal police shootings. For example, if a person dies as a result of grossly negligent medical treatment by a police doctor whilst in custody, that is still a death in custody.

A suicide can also be a death in custody, as can for example, a death following a fight between prisoners, if there is an indication that a prison or other officer or the prison has negligently failed to prevent the death.
