In-custody deaths almost invariably raise questions and allegations that can only be addressed by a complete autopsy, including toxicologic analysis, appropriate chemical studies, and histologic confirmation of gross impressions. No matter how seemingly obvious the cause of death, questions and allegations often concern other issues such as possible maltreatment of the prisoner, the role of alcohol and drugs, and timely attention to medical needs. Some community groups have a deep mistrust of law enforcement, and an in-custody death automatically heightens suspicion of ‘police brutality.’ A government pathologist is frequently considered to be a part of the law enforcement establishment and therefore viewed as someone prone to ‘cover-up’ for the police. Hence, it is not only necessary to have good photographic documentation of what is present, but also pertinent negatives at autopsy (e.g., presence or absence of neck injury, conjunctival petechiae, and rib fractures) is required. Although somewhat controversial, having another pathologist (representing the family or a segment of the community) witness the autopsy may go far toward alleviating suspicions of a cover-up. Police and prosecutors are often reluctant to allow an outside pathologist, particularly if chosen by the family, to witness this autopsy. However, it should be realized that a pathologist hired by the family would do a second autopsy (often in a funeral home) where misinterpretation of postmortem and post-autopsy artifact is quite possible or even likely. In general, it may be wiser to have the second pathologist observe the first autopsy rather than misinterpret post-autopsy artifact. It is nonetheless acknowledged that some circumstances may prohibit any first-hand observation by an outside pathologist.
