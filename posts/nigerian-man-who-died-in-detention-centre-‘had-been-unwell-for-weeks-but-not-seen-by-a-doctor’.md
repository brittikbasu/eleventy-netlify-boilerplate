  A Nigerian man who died in a British detention centre repeatedly said he felt
  unwell but was not seen by a medical professional, his family have claimed. 


  Oscar Okwurime, 34, was discovered lying in his cell at the Harmondsworth
  removal centre by another detainee last week. The cause of his death is
  unknown but the Home Office said it was being investigated.

His older brother told The Independent his sibling said he was feeling unwell during his first week in the removal centre. 

“I told him straight away: tell the authorities there and they will get you checked,” said the 44-year-old from London, who asked to be named only as Alex.

“That first week, they didn’t do anything. And the second week he said they were still saying nothing. The last time I saw him, he told me he was on a waiting list of about 400. He said he was feeling pain in his side. He hadn’t had any health issues before.”

He added: “It was a pure case of negligence. If someone is in your custody and telling you they’re not feeling well, it’s your duty of care to get them checked.”

Alex said that before his brother’s death he had been detained around three weeks when he entered the country on a visitor’s visa and told the authorities he wished to seek asylum.

“I’m feeling so livid now. Any time I’m alone, I’m in tears. It’s terrible, It’s very painful. I don’t know what to do,” the Nigerian national added. 

A former detainee who was close with Mr Okwurime while he was in Harmondsworth said his friend hadn’t been feeling well and that he had wanted to see a doctor but that “this was not a quick process” in the detention centre.

The man, who did not want to be named, was released from the centre the night before Mr Okwurime died.
